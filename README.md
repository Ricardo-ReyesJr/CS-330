# CS-330

On this project I am working with C++ and openGL to create a 3D image of a house. All textures lighting and shapes are done using only C++ and openGL.

## How do I approach designing software?

- What new design skill has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Having to think a little bit like an artist helped me to visuallize the design idea.
- What design process did you follow your project work?
imagining every thing as primative shapes.
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Simplifing thing helps when it comes to design and art. This is how all 3D art is the even the human body starts with primative shapes. circles, squares and cylenders.

## How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I had to slowly calculate the X,Y,Z position when first starting, amazingly there is not a lot of math required for 3D graphics.
- How did iteration factor into your development?
It factors in all areas of programming, not just in graphics.
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?
It was time consuming, 3D engines such as "Unreal" and software like "Blender" make 3D graphics so much simpler.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visuaslizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educatiuonal pathways?
It allows you to think and understand how 3D graphics are developed allowing you to understand how positions, texturing, lighting, etc. is developed. This way when using 3D software and engines it allows you to understand and work much easier and faster.
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
This allows the programer the understanding of how 3D shapes work and are created in a scene and other programs.
